Instructions to run and test service:
Use URL = walnut-backend.vercel.app to test directly, otherwise to run in local environment install Dependencies. then run Python3 main.py to run the server. It'll provide URL for running server, use Postman, etc to run tests for the API.  
1. API Details
Create an endpoint that accepts transaction webhooks:
Webhook Endpoint: POST /v1/webhooks/transactions
Request Body:
{
"transaction_id":"txn_abc123def456",
"source_account":"acc_user_789",
"destination_account":"acc_merchant_456",
"amount": 1500,
"currency":"INR"
}
Create a health check endpoint:
Health Check Endpoint: GET / (root path)
Response:
{"status":"HEALTHY",
"current_time":"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
}
Create an endpoint to retrieve transaction status [for testing]:
Query Endpoint: GET /v1/transactions/{transaction_id}
Response:
{"transaction_id":"txn_abc123def456",
"source_account":"acc_user_789",
"destination_account":"acc_merchant_456",
"amount": 150.50,
"currency":"USD",
"status":
"PROCESSED"
, // or
"PROCESSING"
"created_at":"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
"processed_at":"2024-01-15T10:30:30Z" // null if still processing
}
2. Response Requirements
Must return 202 Accepted status code
Must respond within 500ms regardless of processing complexity
Response body can be empty or contain a simple acknowledgment
3. Background Processing
Process each transaction after receiving the webhook
Processing must include a 30-second delay (simulate external API calls)
Store the final result in persistent storage
4. Idempotency
Multiple webhooks with the same transaction_id should only result in one processed
transaction
Your service should handle this gracefully without errors or duplicate processing
5. Data Storage
Store processed transactions with their status and timing information.
Success Criteria 🎯
Your solution will be tested with:
1.Single Transaction: Send one webhook → verify it's processed after ~30 seconds
2.Duplicate Prevention: Send the same webhook multiple times → verify only one transaction is processed
3.Performance: Webhook endpoint responds quickly even under processing load
4.Reliability: Service handles errors gracefully and doesn't lose transactions
Technical Freedom 🚀
